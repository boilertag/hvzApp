there are 4 projects in this directory: kitchenSink, myApp, myBlank, and mySide

kitchenSink is a demo app that features a lot of example elements which is really nice. based off of krisrak's project: https://github.com/krisrak/ionic-angularjs-kitchensink

myApp was the first iteration of BLT's hvz app. it was based off a tab template and was the first implementation of the home screen's layout.

myBlank is based off of the blank template, and doesn't really do anything.

mySide is the current (up-to-date) app that showcases the home template, some resemblance of a theme, and a sidebar.
